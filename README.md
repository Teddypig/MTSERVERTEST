# MTSERVERTEST
An open source Python GUI for Minetest (http://www.minetest.net) server creation.

My goal is to make a GUI for making a server for Minetest (in Python). Not everyone knows what parts of files to edit to make the server do what they want. I also would like to add certain things you can't currently do with Minetest, such as a game to console chat, on the fly kicking and banning from console, and various others.

## TO-DO
* Make a TO-DO list [In Progress]
* Get user's executable path [DONE!]
* Make window [Done!]
* Make tabs [Done!]
* Make Buttons [60%]
* Make Checks [Working on it]
* Make Entries and Labels [50%]
* Make GUI launch Minetest [DONE!]
* Make it launch, shutdown, and restart Minetest [DONE!]
* Make it write the setting to minetest.conf [Easy, but not needed yet]
* Get Console to Game chat working [This will take a while]
* Add in-game commands []
* Add More To This List [This shit's never ending...]
