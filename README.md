# MTSERVERTEST
An open source GUI for Minetest (http://www.minetest.net) server creation.

My goal is to make a GUI for making a server for Minetest. Not everyone knows what parts of files to edit to make the server do what they want. I also would like to add certain things you can't currently do with Minetest, such as a game to console chat, on the fly kicking and banning from console, and various others.
